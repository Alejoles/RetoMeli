### Run with docker

Be sure you have docker installed, then open the console and type:

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will run the project


### Run Project (Virtualenv)


- **First Step**, Create a virtual environment with **one** of the commands below.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

- **Second Step**, Access to the virtual environment with the next command:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    That should activate the virtual environment to work with it.

- **Third Step**, Install python libraries needed. Inside the virtual environment do:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This will install all libraries needed to run the proyect.

- **Fourth Step**, Run the project and see if it works!
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    Then access to localhost:8000 and check if everything is ok.
